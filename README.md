 idea:  we also have a gaming YouTube channel:

It doesn’t have a lot of views now, but there’s a solid audience and real potential. I’m thinking of creating a simple multiplayer game something in the style of Agario, or even a direct clone with different visuals. We’d integrate a crypto token so players can play and earn.

For example, lobbies with 50 players each puts in $5, and the last one standing wins $100. Simple mechanics, low barrier, but real engagement and incentives. If you have a better variation of this model or another game concept that fits the channel and audience, I’m open to hearing it.



 Please provide me what exactly what are the simple features can be added to create the above game.


Summary:
First platform: move fast, semi-ready product to test reactions.
Second platform: needs to have perfect quality, because reputation matters.

Waiting for your feedback!
